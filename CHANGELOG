=========

This document describes changes between each past release.

Note to release creators: Please ensure that on master there is always a
                          "TBD\n---\n\n" section at the start, followed by
                          the section of the previous release in
                          "<version> (<date>)\n---\n\n" format. This ensures
                          that extract_from_hg.py can find where to insert
                          entries automatically.
